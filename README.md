## Escape Rooms
Due to the nature of puzzle rooms, I will not giveaway the solutions here, but will at least share the general aesthetic of each room:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="GIFs/Bedroom.png" width = "170" height = "200">
  <img src="GIFs/Office.png" width = "170" height = "200">
  <img src="GIFs/Toilet.png" width = "170" height = "200">
  <img src="GIFs/ShoppingMall.png" width = "170" height = "200">
  <img src="GIFs/End.png" width = "170" height = "200">
</div>

### Grab
Players can grab most items to move from one point to another, the usual method of solving puzzles within this game.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="GIFs/Pickup.gif" width = "500" height = "500">
</div>

### Grow and Shrink
Change the size and perspective of the character, if there are items held, they will change size accordingly as well.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="GIFs/Grow.gif" width = "500" height = "500">
  <img src="GIFs/Shrink.gif" width = "500" height = "500">
</div>

### Push and Pull
Best used to help keep distance while moving items around to check for interactivity.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="GIFs/PushPull.gif" width = "500" height = "500">
</div>

### Zoom
Zoom in on the scene, making sure no hints, great or small, would be missed.

  <img src="GIFs/Zoom.gif" width = "500" height = "500">
</div>
